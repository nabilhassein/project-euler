Solutions to Project Euler problems.

I've been programming a lot of Haskell recently,
but I'm trying to solve these problems in elegant and idiomatic Python.
Suggestions for improvement are very welcome!

My code is under the BSD license, so do whatever you want.

To make my solutions as easy to read as possible, the problem statements are
included my source file. Credit for them belongs to projecteuler.net,
so you might need to remove it if you reuse my code for something else.

Solutions are my original work except where noted in the individual source file.
