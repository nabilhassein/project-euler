Solutions to Project Euler problems.

I've been programming a lot of Haskell recently,
but I'm trying to solve these problems in idiomatic Python.
Suggestions for improvement are very welcome!

To make my solutions as easy to read as possible,
the problem statements are included my source file.
Credit for them belongs to projecteuler.net.

BSD license so do whatever you want.

Solutions are my original work except where noted in the individual source file.
