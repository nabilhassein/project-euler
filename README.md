Solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

I've been programming a lot of Haskell recently,
but I'm trying to solve these problems in elegant and idiomatic Python.
Suggestions for improvement are very welcome!

My code is under the Simplified BSD license, so do whatever you want.

To make my solutions as easy to read as possible, the statement of each problem
is included at the top of the relevant my source file.
Credit for them belongs to Project Euler; while I'm pretty sure this is fair use,
you might need to remove them if you reuse my code for something else.
I am not a lawyer.

Solutions are my original work except where noted in the individual source file.
